# SIGNAL RECOVERY FROM QUANTIZED SPARSIFIED MEASUREMENTS WITH IMPERFECT SIDE INFORMATION


## Introduction
1) The problem of recovering a signal x from a linear transform followed by element-wise non-linear measurements arises in a wide range of problems in signal processing, machine learning and communications.

The transform matrix can be either 

- undercomplete (for example, in the case of compressive sensing problems);

- orthonormal (for example, in the case of comression tasks);

- overcomplete (for example, in the case of problems related with retrieval).

The Shannon rate-distortion function is a lower theoretical bound for the formulated problem.

2) At the same time, a lot of attention is dedicated to the problem of signal estimation or denoising from a noisy measurement.

The maximum a posteriory estimation (MAP) is a lower theoretical bound for the for this type of problems.

3) New set up: a joint problem of recovering a generic signal x from sparsified and quantized measurements y = Q(phi(Ax)) with a generic matrix A, a sparsification operator phi(.), quantization Q(.) and with side information x0.
